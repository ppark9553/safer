### Gobble: Mined and Keystone's data scraping engine.


--- Need for Gobble ---

1. Kiwoom OpenAPI has bad performance, initialization will take roughly 18 days if your database requires collection of all OHLCV, Buy, and Sell data

2. Thus, borrow the power of pandas_datareader and other API's for initialization


--- How Gobble runs ---

1. Collects Kospi OHLCV data with: "pdreader.py"

2. Collects Kospi, Kosdaq Buy, Sell data with: "kiwoom.py"

3. Collects Kosdaq OHLCV data with: ""

4. Connects to MongoDB with: "dbconnector.py"

5. Threads processes concurrently running the aforementioned tasks: "gobble.py"
